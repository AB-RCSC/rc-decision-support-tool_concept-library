<p>{#access_method}
<strong>*Access Method</strong>
: The method used to reach the camera location (e.g., on “Foot,” “ATV,” “Helicopter,” etc.).</p>
<p>{#age_class_adult}
<strong>Adult</strong>
: Animals that are old enough to breed; reproductively mature.</p>
<p>{#age_class}
<strong>Age Class</strong>
: The age classification of individual(s) being categorized (e.g., “Adult,” “Juvenile,” “Subadult,” “Subadult - Young of Year,” “Subadult - Yearling”, or “Unknown”).</p>
<p>{#analyst}
<strong>Analyst</strong>
: The first and last names of the individual who provided the observation data point (species identification and associated information). If there are multiple analysts for an observation, enter the primary analyst.</p>
<p>{#animal_id}
<strong>*Animal ID</strong>
: A unique ID for an animal that can be uniquely identified (e.g., marked in some way). If multiple unique individuals are identified, enter an Animal ID for each as a unique row. Leave blank if not applicable.</p>
<p>{#baitlure_audible_lure}
Audible lure
: Sounds imitating noises of prey or conspecifics that draw animals closer by eliciting curiosity (Schlexer, 2008).</p>
<p>{#baitlure_bait}
Bait
: A food item (or other substance) that is placed to attract animals via the sense of taste and olfactory cues (Schlexer, 2008).</p>
<p>{#baitlure_bait_lure_type}
<strong>Bait/Lure Type</strong>
: The type of bait or lure used at a camera location. Record “None” if a Bait/Lure Type was not used and “Unknown” if not known. If “Other,” describe in the Deployment Comments.</p>
<p>{#batteries_replaced}
<strong>*Batteries Replaced</strong>
: Whether the camera’s batteries were replaced.</p>
<p>{#behaviour}
<strong>*Behaviour</strong>
: The behaviour of the individual(s) being categorized (e.g., “Standing,” “Drinking,” “Vigilant,” etc.).</p>
<p>{#camera_active_on_arrival}
<strong>*Camera Active On Arrival</strong>
: Whether a camera was functional upon arrival.</p>
<p>{#camera_active_on_departure}
<strong>*Camera Active On Departure</strong>
: Whether a camera was functional upon departure.</p>
<p>{#camera_angle}
Camera angle
: The degree at which the camera is pointed toward the FOV Target Feature relative to the horizontal ground surface (with respect to slope, if applicable).</p>
<p>{#camera_attachment}
<strong>*Camera Attachment</strong>
: The method/tools used to attach the camera (e.g., attached to a tree with a bungee cord; reported as codes such as “Tree + Bungee/Strap”). If “Other,” describe in the Camera Location Comments.</p>
<p>{#camera_damaged}
<strong>*Camera Damaged</strong>
: Whether the camera was damaged or malfunctioning; if there is any damage to the device (physical or mechanical), the crew should describe the damage in the Service/Retrieval Comments.</p>
<p>{#camera_days_per_camera_location}
Camera days per camera location
: The number of days each camera was active and functioning during the period it was deployed (e.g., 24-hour periods or the difference in days between the Deployment Start Date Time and the Deployment End Date Time if there were no interruptions).</p>
<p>{#camera_direction}
<strong>*Camera Direction (degrees)</strong>
: The cardinal direction that a camera faces. Ideally, cameras should face north (N; i.e. “0” degrees), or south (S; i.e. “180” degrees) if north is not possible. The Camera Direction should be chosen to ensure the field of view (FOV) is of the original FOV target feature.</p>
<p>{#camera_height}
<strong>Camera Height (m)</strong>
: The height from the ground (below snow) to the bottom of the lens (metres; to the nearest 0.05 m).</p>
<p>{#camera_id}
<strong>Camera ID</strong>
: A unique alphanumeric ID for the camera that distinguishes it from other cameras of the same make or model.</p>
<p>{#camera_location}
Camera location
: The location where a single camera was placed (recorded as “Camera Location Name”).</p>
<p>{#camera_location_characteristics}
<strong>*Camera Location Characteristic(s)</strong>
: Any significant features around the camera at the time of the visit. This may include for example, manmade or natural linear features (e.g., trails), habitat types (e.g., wetlands), wildlife structure (e.g., beaver dam). If “Other,” describe in the Camera Location Comments.
: Camera Location Characteristics differ from FOV Target Features in that Camera Location Characteristics could include those not in the camera’s Field of View. If “Other,” describe in the Camera Location Comments.</p>
<p>{#camera_location_comments}
<strong>*Camera Location Comments</strong>
: Comments describing additional details about a camera location.</p>
<p>{#camera_location_name}

<p>{#settings_motion_image_interval}
<strong>Motion Image Interval (seconds)</strong>
: The time (in seconds) between images within a multi-image sequence that occur due to motion, heat, or activation of external detector devices. The Motion Image Interval is pre-set in the camera’s settings by the user, but the time at which the camera collects images because of this setting is influenced by the presence of movement or heat. For example, if the camera was set to take 3 images per event at a Motion Image Interval of 3 seconds when the camera detects motion or heat, the first image will be collected (e.g., at 09:00:00), the second image will be collected 3 seconds later (09:00:03), and the third will be collected 3 seconds after that (09:00:06).

<p>{#mods_overdispersion}
Overdispersion
: A variance significantly larger than the mean (Bliss &amp; Fisher, 1953); greater variability in a set of data than predicted by the error structure of the model (Harrison et al., 2018); excess variability can be caused by zero inflation, non-independence of counts, or both (Zuur et al., 2009).</p>

<p>{#sequence}
Sequence
: A user-defined group of images or video clips considered as a single “detection event” (recorded as “Sequence Name”); often users choose a certain time threshold (or “inter-detection interval”) to define independent “events”; e.g., 30 minutes or 1 hour. The threshold should be recorded in the Survey Design Description).</p>
<p>{#sequence_name}
<strong>Sequence Name</strong>
: A unique alphanumeric identifier for a multi-image sequence. The Sequence Name should ideally consist of the Deployment Name and the names of the first and last images and videos in the sequence (separated by “_”) (i.e., “Deployment Name”,_“,img_#[name of first image in sequence],”_”,img_#[name of last image in sequence] (e.g., “bh1_22-Jul-2018_img_001-img_005”). Leave blank if not applicable.</p>

The relevant metadata fields that should be collected differ when a camera is deployed vs. serviced or retrieved.
: Refer to Appendix - Table A5 and the Camera Service/Retrieval Field Datasheet.</p>
<p>{#service_retrieval_visit}

<p>{#mods_ste}
Space-to-event (STE) model (Moeller et al., 2018)
: A method used to estimate abundance or density that accounts for variable detection probability through the use of time-lapse images and is unaffected by animal movement rates (collapses sampling intervals to an instant in time, and thus estimates are unaffected by animal movement rates) (Moeller et al., 2018).</p>
<p>{#spatial_autocorrelation}
Spatial autocorrelation
: The tendency for locations that are closer together to be more similar.</p>
<p>{#mods_sc}
Spatial count (SC) model / Unmarked spatial capture-recapture (Chandler &amp; Royle, 2013)
: A method used to estimate the density of unmarked populations; similar to SECR (Borchers &amp; Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle &amp; Young, 2008; Royle et al., 2009); however, SC models account for individuals’ unknown identities using the spatial pattern of detections (Chandler &amp; Royle, 2013; Sun et al., 2022). SC uses trap-specific counts to estimate the location and number of activity centres to estimate density.</p>
<p>{#mods_smr}
Spatial mark-resight (SMR) (Chandler &amp; Royle, 2013; Sollmann et al., 2013a, 2013b)
: A method used to estimate the density of “partially marked populations by combining… [detection] histories of marked [individuals] and counts of unmarked [individuals]” (Doran-Myers, 2018) over several occasions (Sollman et al., 2013a; Rich et al., 2014; Whittington et al., 2018). SMR models can be implemented using different statistical frameworks, including Bayesian estimation (Royle and Young, 2008; Morin et al., 2022).</p>
<p>{#mods_2flankspim}
Spatial partial identity model (2-flank SPIM) (Augustine et al., 2018)
: A method used to estimate the density of partially marked populations in which the “spatial locations of where partial identity samples are captured to probabilistically resolve their complete identities” (Augustine et al., 2018). Paired sampling design is commonly used to capture both the right and left flanks of an animal to resolve individual identities (Augustine et al., 2018). 2-flank SPIM is an extension of the SCR model (Borchers &amp; Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle &amp; Young, 2008; Royle et al., 2009).</p>
<p>{#mods_scr_secr}
Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) / Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) (Borchers &amp; Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle &amp; Young, 2008; Royle et al., 2009)
: The SECR (or SCR) method is used to estimate the density of marked populations; an extension of traditional capture-recapture (CR; Karanth, 1995; Karanth &amp; Nichols, 1998) models (Karanth, 1995; Karanth &amp; Nichols, 1998) that explicitly accounts for camera location and animal movement (Burgar et al., 2018). SECR models use spatially referenced individual capture histories to infer where animals’ home range centres are, assuming that detection probability decreases with increasing distance between cameras and home range centres (Clarke et al., 2023). SECR models can be implemented using different statistical frameworks, including Bayesian estimation (Royle and Young, 2008; Morin et al., 2022).</p>

<p>{#state_variable}
State variable
: A formal measure that summarizes the state of a community or population at a particular time (Wearn &amp; Glover-Kapfer, 2017), e.g., species richness or population abundance.</p>
<p>{#sampledesign_stratified}
Stratified design
: The area of interest is divided into smaller strata (e.g., habitat type, disturbance levels), and cameras are placed within each stratum (e.g., 15%, 35% and 50% of sites within high, medium, and low disturbance strata).</p>
<p>{#sampledesign_stratified_random}
Stratified random design
: The area of interest is divided into smaller strata (e.g., habitat type, disturbance levels), and then a proportional random sample of sites is selected within each stratum (e.g., 15%, 35% and 50% of sites within high, medium and low disturbance strata).</p>
<p>{#study_area}
Study area
: A unique research, inventory or monitoring area (spatial boundary) within a project (there may be multiple study areas within a single project) (recorded as “Study Area Name”).</p>
<p>{#study_area_description}
<strong>Study Area Description</strong>
: A description for each unique research or monitoring area including its location, the habitat type(s), land use(s) and habitat disturbances (where applicable).</p>
<p>{#study_area_name}
<strong>Study Area Name</strong>
: A unique alphanumeric identifier for each study area (e.g.,”oilsands_ref1”). If only one area was surveyed, the Project Name and Study Area Name should be the same.</p>

<!--. 
-->
<p>{#survey}
Survey
: A unique deployment period (temporal extent) within a project (recorded as “Survey Name”).</p>
<!--. 
-->
<p>{#survey_design}
<strong>Survey Design</strong>
: The spatial arrangement of remote cameras within the study area for an individual survey. If “Hierarchical (multiple)*”, include additional details in the Survey Design Description.
: Note that we refer to different configurations of cameras more generally as study design and sampling design; however, the term “Survey Design” refers to study design as it applies to an individual survey. There may be multiple Survey Designs for surveys within a project; if this occurs, the Survey Design should be reported separately for each survey.</p>
<p>{#survey_design_description}
<strong>*Survey Design Description</strong>
: A description of any additional details about the Survey Design.</p>
<p>{#survey_name}
<strong>Survey Name</strong>
: A unique alphanumeric identifier for each survey period (e.g., “fortmc_001”).</p>
<p>{#survey_objectives}
<strong>Survey Objectives</strong>
: The specific objectives of each survey within a project, including the Target Species, the state variables (e.g., occupancy, density), and proposed modelling approach(es). Survey Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (i.e., SMART).</p>
<p>{#sampledesign_systematic}
Systematic design
: Camera locations occur in a regular pattern (e.g., a grid pattern) across the study area.</p>
<p>{#sampledesign_systematic_random}
Systematic random design
: Camera locations are selected using a two-stage approach. Firstly, girds are selected systematically (to occur within a regular pattern) across the study area. The location of the camera within each grid is then selected randomly.</p>
<p>{#tag}
<strong>Tag</strong>
: When individuals, or groups of individuals, are categorized within an image, regardless of whether the information applies to all of the individuals in the image. A single tag is applied to categorize one or more individuals with the same combination of characteristics (e.g., Adult Males displaying the same Behaviour). Conversely, multiple tags are applied when individuals in an image differ in their characteristics (e.g., an Adult and a Juvenile, all else remaining equal, are tagged separately). This could also occur for Age Class, Behaviour, Human Transport Mode/Activity, etc. Since multiple tags can occur for a single image, there may be multiple data rows for the same image (if the Event Type is at the “Tag” level).</p>
<p>{#target_species}
<strong>Target Species</strong>
: The common name(s) of the species that the survey was designed to detect.</p>
<p>{#sampledesign_targeted}
Targeted design
: Camera locations or sample stations are placed in areas that are known or suspected to have higher activity levels (e.g., game trails, mineral licks).</p>
<p>{#test_image}
Test image
: An image taken from a camera after it has been set up to provide a permanent record of the visit metadata (e.g., Sample Station Name, Camera Location Name, Deployment Name, Crew, and Deployment Start Date Time [DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM:SS]).
: Taking a test image can be useful to compare the information from the image to that of which was collected on the Camera Service/Retrieval Field Datasheet after retrieval and can help in reducing recording errors.</p>
<p>{#test_image_taken}
<strong>*Test Image Taken</strong>
: Whether a test image (i.e., an image taken from a camera after it has been set up to provide a permanent record of the visit metadata) was taken. Arm the camera, from ~5 m in front, walk towards the camera while holding the Test Image Sheet.</p>
<dl class="simple myst">
<dt>{#mods_tifc}</dt><dd><p>Time in front of the camera (TIFC) (Huggard, 2018; Warbington &amp; Boyce, 2020; tested in Becker et al., 2022)</p>
</dd>
<dd><p>A method used to estimate density that treats camera image data as quadrat samples (Becker et al., 2022).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>{#timelapse_image}
Time-lapse image
: Images that are taken at regular intervals (e.g., hourly or daily, on the hour). It is critical to take a minimum of one time-lapse image per day at a consistent time (e.g., 12:00 pm [noon]) to create a record of camera functionality and local environmental conditions (e.g., snow cover, plant growth, etc.). Time-lapse images may always be useful for modelling approaches that require estimation of the “viewshed” (“viewshed density estimators” such as REM or time-to-event (TTE) models; see Moeller et al., [2018] for advantages and disadvantages).</p>
<p>{#mods_tte}
Time-to-event (TTE) model (Moeller et al., 2018)
: A method used to estimate abundance or density from the detection rate while accounting for animal movement rates (Moeller et al., 2018). The TTE model assumes perfect detection (though there is a model extension to account for imperfect detection that requires further testing).</p>
<p>{#total_number_of_camera_days}
Total number of camera days
: The number of days that all cameras were active during the survey.</p>
<p>{#trigger_event}
Trigger “event”
: An activation of the camera detector(s) that initiates the capture of a single or multiple images, or the recording of video.</p>
<p>{#settings_trigger_modes}
<strong>Trigger Mode(s)</strong> (camera settings)
: The camera setting(s) that determine how the camera will triggerby motion (“Motion Image”), at set intervals (“Time-lapse image”), and/or by video (“Video”; possible with newer camera models, such as Reconyx HP2X).</p>
<p>{#settings_trigger_sensitivity}
<strong>Trigger Sensitivity</strong>
: The camera setting responsible for how sensitive a camera is to activation (to “triggering”) via the infrared and/or heat detectors (if applicable, e.g., Reconyx HyperFire cameras have a choice between “Low,” “Low/Med,” “Med,” “Med/High,” “High,” “Very high” and “Unknown”).</p>
<p>{#trigger_speed}
Trigger speed
: The time delay necessary for the camera to shoot a photo once an animal has interrupted the infrared beam within the camera’s detection zone (Trolliet et al., 2014). Trigger speed differs from Motion Image Interval (a camera setting specified by the user) in that the trigger speed is inherent to the Camera Make and Camera Model (e.g., two different cameras, models both with a Motion Image Interval set to “no delay,” may not be able to capture images at the same speed).</p>
<p>{#typeid_unmarked}
Unmarked individuals / populations / species
: Individuals, populations, or species (varies with modelling approach and context) that cannot be identified using natural or artificial markings (e.g., coat patterns, scars, tags, collars). Unmarked population models rely on supplementary data (e.g., animal movement speed) and/or assumptions as a surrogate for individual identification; that is, to distinguish between multiple detections of the same individual from detections of multiple individuals when individuals do not have unique features (Gilbert et al., 2020; Morin et al., 2022).</p>
<p>{#settings_userlabel}
User label
: A label (up to 16 characters) that can be programmed in the camera’s settings, and that will be visible in the data band of all photos and videos taken by the camera (Reconyx, 2018). It is recommended that users program the Sample Station Name/Camera Location Name as the user label, which serves as a means to confirm which Sample Station Name/Camera Location Name is associated with the images/videos.</p>
<p>{#utm_zone_camera_location}
<strong>UTM Zone Camera Location</strong>
: The number corresponding to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid zone where the camera was placed (e.g., “12”). UTM is a coordinate system that divides the earth into grid zones that are identified with a number (representing a width of latitude) and letter (representing the hemisphere).
: In Alberta the UTM zones are either 11, 12, or TTM. Enter all other UTM zones in the Camera Location Comments field (e.g., zones 7-10 for British Columbia), or use Latitude and Longitude instead of UTM coordinates.</p>
<p>{#settings_video_length}
<strong>*Video Length (seconds)</strong>
: If applicable, describes the camera setting that specifies the minimum video duration (in seconds) that the camera will record when triggered. Leave blank if not applicable.</p>
<p>{#fov_viewshed}
Viewshed
: The area visible to the camera as determined by its lens angle (in degrees) and trigger distance (Moeller et al., 2023).</p>
<p>{#fov_viewshed_density_estimators}
Viewshed density estimators
: Methods used to estimate the abundance of unmarked populations from observations of animals that relate animal observations to the space directly sampled by each camera’s viewshed (Moeller et al., 2023); they result in viewshed density estimates that can be extrapolated to abundance within broader sampling frames (Gilbert et al., 2020; Moeller et al., 2023).</p>
<p>{#visit}
Visit
: When a crew has gone to a location to deploy, service, or retrieve a remote camera.</p>

: Comments describing additional details about the deployment and/or service/retrieval visits.</p>
<p>{#visit_metadata}
Visit metadata
: Metadata that should be collected each time a camera location is visited to deploy, service or retrieve a camera. Other relevant metadata fields that should be collected differ when a camera is deployed vs. serviced or retrieved. <br/>Refer to Appendix A - Table A5, Camera Deployment Field Datasheet, and Camera Service/Retrieval Field Datasheet.</p>
<p>{#baitlure_visual_lure}
Visual lure
: Any material that draws animals closer via their sense of sight (Schlexer, 2008).</p>
<p>{#walktest}
Walktest
: A test performed to ensure the camera height, tilt, etc., adequately captures the desired detection zone. The user will 1) activate the walktest mode, 2) attach the camera at the desired height / angle, 3) walk in front of the camera to a specified distance (i.e., the “Walktest Distance,” e.g., 5 m), and 4) wave their hand in front of the camera (usually at ground level and a chosen height [i.e., the “Walktest Height,” e.g., 0.8 m]) to determine if the camera is activating (a light on the camera will flash).</p>
<p>{#walktest_complete}
<strong>*Walktest Complete</strong>
: Whether a walktest was performed to ensure the camera height, tilt, etc., adequately captures the desired detection zone. The user will 1) activate the walktest mode, 2) attach the camera at the desired height / angle, 3) walk in front of the camera to a specified distance (i.e., the “Walktest Distance,” e.g., 5 m), and 4) wave their hand in front of the camera (usually at ground level and a chosen height [i.e., the “Walktest Height,” e.g., 0.8 m]) to determine if the camera is activating (a light on the camera will flash).</p>
<p>{#walktest_distance}
<strong>Walktest Distance (m)</strong>
: The horizontal distance from the camera at which the crew performs the walktest (metres; to the nearest 0.05 m). Leave blank if not applicable.</p>
<p>{#walktest_height}
<strong>Walktest Height (m)</strong>
: The vertical distance from the camera at which the crew performs the walktest (metres; to the nearest 0.05 m). Leave blank if not applicable.</p>
<p>{#mods_zinb}
Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression (McCullagh &amp; Nelder, 1989)
: A regression model used in the setting of excess zeros (zero-inflation) and overdispersion. This approach is a two-part model, where the zero-inflation is modelled separately from the counts and assumes that the count (abundance) is “conditional” on the zero-inflation model (occurrence) model. [relative abundance indices]</p>
<p>{#mods_zip}
Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression (Lambert, 1992)
: A regression model for count data that both follows the Poisson distribution and contains excess zeros (Lambert, 1992). ZIP models are only appropriate for data for which the overdispersion is not solely due to zero-inflation. [relative abundance indices]</p>
<p>{#mods_zero_inflation}
Zero-inflation
: An excess of zeros that is “so large that those expected in standard distributions (e.g., normal, Poisson, binomial, negative binomial and beta)” (Heilbron, 1994) violate the assumptions of such distributions (Martin et al., 2005). Excess zeroes can be a result of ecological effects (“true” zeros) or due to sampling or observer error (“false zeros”) (Martin et al., 2005). Excess zeroes contribute to overdispersion, but they don’t necessarily account for all excess variability (Blasco-Moreno et al., 2019).</p>
