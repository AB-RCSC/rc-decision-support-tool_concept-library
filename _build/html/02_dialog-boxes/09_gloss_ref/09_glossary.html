<dt>Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression (McCullagh &amp; Nelder, 1989)</dt><dd><p>A regression model used in the setting of excess zeros (zero-inflation) and overdispersion. This approach is a two-part model, where the zero-inflation is modelled separately from the counts and assumes that the count (abundance) is “conditional” on the zero-inflation model (occurrence) model.

<dt>Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression (Lambert, 1992)</dt><dd><p>A regression model for count data that both follows the Poisson distribution and contains excess zeros (Lambert, 1992). ZIP models are only appropriate for data for which the overdispersion is not solely due to zero-inflation. [relative abundance indices]</p>

<dl class="simple myst" id="mods-zero-inflation">
<dt>Zero-inflation</dt><dd><p>An excess of zeros that is “so large that those expected in standard distributions (e.g., normal, Poisson, binomial, negative binomial and beta)” (Heilbron, 1994) violate the assumptions of such distributions (Martin et al., 2005). Excess zeroes can be a result of ecological effects (“true” zeros) or due to sampling or observer error (“false zeros”) (Martin et al., 2005). Excess zeroes contribute to overdispersion, but they don’t necessarily account for all excess variability (Blasco-Moreno et al., 2019).</p>
