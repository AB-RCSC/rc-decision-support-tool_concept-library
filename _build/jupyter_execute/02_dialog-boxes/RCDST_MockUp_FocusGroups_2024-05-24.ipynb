    "**Capture-recapture (CR) model / Capture-mark-recapture (CMR) model (Karanth, 1995; Karanth & Nichols, 1998)**: A method of estimating the abundance or density of marked populations using the number of animals detected and the likelihood animals will be detected (detection probability). CR (Karanth, 1995; Karanth & Nichols, 1998) can be used to estimate vital rates where all newly detected unmarked animals become marked and are distinguishable in future (Efford, 2022). Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR; Borchers & Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle & Young, 2008) models have largely replaced CR and CMR models and provide more accurate density estimates (Blanc et al., 2013, Obbard et al., 2010, Sollmann et al., 2011).\n",

    "To estimate density using camera trap CR, we must first estimate population size ùëÅ. CR models use individuals‚Äô detection histories ‚Äì that is, the record of when each individual was photographed or not photographed (i.e., (re)captured or not (re)captured) ‚Äì to solve for ùëÅ (Figure 3; Royle 2020). Population-level detection histories look like a matrix of 1s and 0s, where 1s signify that an individual was captured during a given sampling occasion ùëò, and 0s signify that the individual was not captured during that occasion (Royle 2020, Royle et al. 2014). The number of individuals photographed at least once over the course of the study (i.e., the count of animals captured) is ùëõ.  \n",
    "Importantly, the count of animals is not the same as the size of the population (i.e., ùëõ ‚â† ùëÅ). Some individuals will never be photographed during a study, even though they are present and able to be detected (i.e., they are in ùëÅ but not in ùëõ; Royle 2020). Using the matrix of detection histories, we must therefore calculate the likelihood animals will be detected by an array of camera traps ‚Äì that is, detection probability p (Royle 2020). \n",
    "Taking this information together, we can calculate population size ùëÅ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} ./03_images/00_demo/Clarke-et-al_2023_eqn_cr1.png\n",
    ":width: 80px\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which is often referred to as the canonical estimator of population size (Royle 2020). Population size ùëÅ can then be divided by an estimate of the area of the sampling frame ùê¥ to obtain density. \n",
    "CR models have important limitations ‚Äì notably that they do not consider the spatial configuration of camera traps or the spatial pattern of animal detections. This gives rise to two major issues: \n",
    "The sampling frame ùê¥ is not known (Chandler and Royle 2013). In other words: the true area animals occupy is never measured, only approximated using adhoc approaches (e.g., using a buffer strip around the trap array; Rich et al. 2014, Sollmann 2018). Consequently, density cannot be calculated explicitly (Chandler and Royle 2013), and CR-derived density estimates are somewhat arbitrary and difficult to compare across studies (Green et al. 2020, Royle et al. 2014, Sollmann 2018). \n",
    "Detection probability is assumed to be the same across all individuals and sampling occasions, even though the likelihood a given individual is detected at a given camera trap will change with its proximity to that trap. An animal that occupies territory far away from a trap is less likely to be detected there than one that lives nearby, for example (Morin et al. 2022). \n",
    "The standard CR model has largely been phased out with the advent of spatially-explicit CR models (see 2.1.2 Spatial Capture-Recapture; Burton et al. 2015, Sollmann 2008), which address the shortcomings of CR and have been shown to produce more accurate density estimates (e.g., Blanc et al. 2013, Obbard et al. 2010, Sollmann et al. 2011).\n",

SC uses trap-specific counts to estimate the location and number of activity centres to estimate density.\n",
    "\n",

    ":   A method used to estimate the density of partially marked populations in which the ‚Äúspatial locations of where partial identity samples are captured to probabilistically resolve their complete identities‚Äù (Augustine et al., 2018). Paired sampling design is commonly used to capture both the right and left flanks of an animal to resolve individual identities (Augustine et al., 2018). 2-flank SPIM is an extension of the SCR model (Borchers & Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle & Young, 2008; Royle et al., 2009).\n",

    ":   The SECR (or SCR) method is used to estimate the density of marked populations; an extension of traditional capture-recapture (CR; Karanth, 1995; Karanth & Nichols, 1998) models (Karanth, 1995; Karanth & Nichols, 1998) that explicitly accounts for camera location and animal movement (Burgar et al., 2018). SECR models use spatially referenced individual capture histories to infer where animals' home range centres are, assuming that detection probability decreases with increasing distance between cameras and home range centres (Clarke et al., 2023). SECR models can be implemented using different statistical frameworks, including Bayesian estimation (Royle and Young, 2008; Morin et al., 2022).\n",

It is critical to take a minimum of one time-lapse image per day at a consistent time (e.g., 12:00 pm [noon]) to create a record of camera functionality and local environmental conditions (e.g., snow cover, plant growth, etc.). Time-lapse images may always be useful for modelling approaches that require estimation of the \"viewshed\" (\"viewshed density estimators\" such as REM or time-to-event (TTE) models; see Moeller et al., [2018] for advantages and disadvantages).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time-to-event (TTE) model (Moeller et al., 2018)**\n",
    ":   A method used to estimate abundance or density from the detection rate while accounting for animal movement rates (Moeller et al., 2018). The TTE model assumes perfect detection (though there is a model extension to account for imperfect detection that requires further testing).\n",

    "**Trigger speed**\n",
    ":   The time delay necessary for the camera to shoot a photo once an animal has interrupted the infrared beam within the camera's detection zone (Trolliet et al., 2014). Trigger speed differs from Motion Image Interval (a camera setting specified by the user) in that the trigger speed is inherent to the Camera Make and Camera Model (e.g., two different cameras, models both with a Motion Image Interval set to \"no delay,\" may not be able to capture images at the same speed).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unmarked individuals / populations / species**\n",
    ":   Individuals, populations, or species (varies with modelling approach and context) that cannot be identified using natural or artificial markings (e.g., coat patterns, scars, tags, collars). Unmarked population models rely on supplementary data (e.g., animal movement speed) and/or assumptions as a surrogate for individual identification; that is, to distinguish between multiple detections of the same individual from detections of multiple individuals when individuals do not have unique features (Gilbert et al., 2020; Morin et al., 2022).\n",

    "\n",
    "**\\*UTM Zone Camera Location**\n",
    ":   The coordinate system that divides geographic areas into north-south zones. In Alberta the UTM zones are either 11, 12, or TTM.

    ":   The area visible to the camera as determined by its lens angle (in degrees) and trigger distance (Moeller et al., 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Viewshed density estimators**\n",
    ":   Methods used to estimate the abundance of unmarked populations from observations of animals that relate animal observations to the space directly sampled by each camera‚Äôs viewshed (Moeller et al., 2023); they result in viewshed density estimates that can be extrapolated to abundance within broader sampling frames (Gilbert et al., 2020; Moeller et al., 2023).\n",
