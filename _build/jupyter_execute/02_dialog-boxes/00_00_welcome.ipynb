    "This tool aims to support your decision-making process when designing a remote camera programs by guiding you through a series of decision points related to your study in the form of an interactive flow chart.\n",
    "At each step, you will be able to access information related to the question in the ‚Äúinfo popups‚Äù; information is provided with different levels of complexity (overview vs. advanced) and in formats that accommodate multiple learning styles (e.g., figures, videos, Shiny apps, etc.). Once you have answered all of the questions, study design recommendations will be generated from your selections, which will include the following:\n",
