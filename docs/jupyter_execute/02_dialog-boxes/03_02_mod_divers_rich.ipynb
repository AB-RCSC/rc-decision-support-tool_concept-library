    "Each of the four assemblages has exactly 100 species and 500 individuals, but they differ in their relative evenness: (1) completely even assemblage (black solid line): each species is represented by five individuals; (2) slightly uneven assemblage (red dashed line): 50 species each represented by seven individuals and 50 species each represented by three individuals (this structure is denoted as {50 x 7, 50 x 3}); (3) moderately uneven assemblage (green dotted line): {22 x 10, 28 x 5, 40 x 3, 10 x 2}; (4) highly uneven assemblage (blue dash–dot line): {1 x 120, 1 x 80, 1 x 70, 1 x 50, 3 x 20, 3 x 10, 90 x 1}. For *q*=0, the Hill number is species richness, which is equal to 100 for all assemblages. Because Hill numbers represent the equivalent number of equally abundant species, the curve for the perfectly even assemblage (black solid line) does not change as q is increased. Larger values of q place progressively more weight on common species, so the equivalent number of equally abundant species is much lower for the more uneven assemblages than for more even assemblages.\n",
