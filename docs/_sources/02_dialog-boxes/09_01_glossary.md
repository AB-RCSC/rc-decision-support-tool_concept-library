A method of estimating the abundance or density of marked populations using the number of animals detected and the likelihood animals will be detected (detection probability). CR (Karanth, 1995; Karanth & Nichols, 1998) can be used to estimate vital rates where all newly detected unmarked animals become marked and are distinguishable in future (Efford, 2022). Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR; Borchers & Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle & Young, 2008) models have largely replaced CR and CMR models and provide more accurate density estimates (Blanc et al., 2013, Obbard et al., 2010, Sollmann et al., 2011).

Refer to Appendix A - Table A5 and Camera Deployment Field Datasheet.

(#deployment_name)=

**Deployment Name**

A unique alphanumeric identifier for a unique camera deployed during a specific survey period (ideally recorded as“Camera Location Name”*“Deployment Start Date” (or …*”Deployment End Date”) (e.g., “bh1_17-Jul-2018" or “bh1_17-Jul-2018_21-Jan-2019”).

Alternative naming conventions may be used, but the goal should be to minimize duplicate Image Names.

(#deployment_start_date_time)=

**Deployment Start Date Time (DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM:SS)**

The date and time that a camera was placed for a specific deployment (e.g., 17-Jan-2018 10:34:22).

The Deployment Start Date Time may not coincide with when the first image or video was collected (i.e., the Image Set Start Date Time). Recording this field allows users to account for deployments where no images were captured and to confirm the first date and time a camera was active.

Whether detections were reported as an individual image captured by the camera (“Image”), a “Sequence,” or “Tag.”

(#false_trigger)=

False trigger

Blank images (no wildlife or human present). These images commonly occur when a camera is triggered by vegetation blowing in the wind.

(#field_of_view)=

Field of View (FOV)

The extent of a scene that is visible in an image (Figure 5); a large FOV is obtained by "zooming out" from a scene, whilst "zooming in" will result in a smaller FOV (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017).

(#settings_flash_output)=

Flash output

The camera setting that provides the level of intensity of the flash (if enabled).

(#fov_target)=

**FOV Target Feature**

A specific man-made or natural feature at which the camera is aimed to maximize the detection of wildlife species or to measure the use of that feature. Record “None” if a FOV Target Feature was not used and "Unknown" if not known. If “Other,” describe in the Camera Location Comments.

**GPS Unit Accuracy (m)**

The margin of error of the GPS unit used to record spatial information (e.g., "5" [m]), such as the coordinates of the camera location. On most GPS units (e.g., "Garmin") this information is provided on the unit’s satellite information page.

(#human_transport_mode_activity)=

**\*Human Transport Mode/Activity**

The activity performed or mode of transportation used by a human observed (e.g., hiker, skier, off-highway vehicle, etc.). This categorical field should be populated when data on humans (in addition to wildlife) are collected. Leave blank if not applicable and record "Unknown" if not known.

(#mods_hurdle)=

Hurdle model (Mullahy, 1986; Heilbron 1994)

A regression model used in the setting of excess zeros (zero-inflation) and overdispersion (Mullahy, 1986). Hurdle models (aka "zero-altered" models) differ from zero-inflation models in that they are two-part models, and the zero and non-zero counts are modelling separately (thus, they are only adequate when the counting process cannot generate a zero value) (Blasco-Moreno et al., 2019). [relative abundance indices]

(#image)=

Image

(#image_classification)=

Image classification

The process of assigning class labels to an image according to the wildlife species, other entities (e.g., human, vehicle), or conditions within the image.

The likelihood of an image containing an object of a certain class (Fennell et al., 2022).

(#image_flash_output)=

**\*Image Flash Output**

The Image Flash Output is an image metadata field indicating the level of intensity of the flash [if enabled/applicable]). Record as reported in the image Exif data (e.g., "Flash Did Not Fire", "Auto"). This field is in text format; record "Unknown" if not known; leave blank if not applicable.

Record as reported in the image Exif data (e.g., "On" or "Off"). This field is categorical; leave blank if not applicable and record "Unknown" if not known.

(#image_name)=

**Image Name**

A unique alphanumeric identifier for the image. It is important to include (at a minimum) the camera location, date, time, and image number when generating an Image Name to avoid duplicate file names (e.g., "bh1_17-Jul-2018_P900FF04152022_22-Jul-2018 10:34:22_img_100" or "bh1_17-Jul-2018_22-Jul-2018_10:34:22_img_100").

(#image_processing)=

Image processing

The series of operations that are taken to extract information from images. In the case of remote camera data, it can include loading the images into a processing platform, extracting information from the image metadata (e.g., the date and time the image was taken), running an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to identify empty images, classifying animals or other entities within the image.

(#image_sequence)=

Image Sequence

The order of the image in a rapid-fire sequence as reported in the image Exif data (text; e.g., "1 of 1" or "1 of 3"). Leave blank if not applicable.

**Image Set End Date Time (DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM:SS)**

The date and time of the last image or video collected during a specific deployment (e.g., "17-Jan-2018 22:10:05").

The Image Set End Date Time may not coincide with the deployment end date time. Recording this field allows users to account for deployments that were conducted but for which no data was found and to confirm the last date and time a camera was active (if functioning) if no images or videos were captured prior to Service/Retrieval (especially valuable if users did not collect Time-lapse images or if the camera malfunctioned).

(#image_set_start_date_time)=

**Image Set Start Date Time (DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM:SS)**

The date and time of the first image or video collected during a specific deployment (e.g., “17-Jan-2018 12:00:02”).

The Image Set Start Date Time may not coincide with the Deployment Start Date Time. Recording this field allows users to confirm the first date and time a camera was active (reliable if Time-lapse images were collected; especially valuable if the user scheduled a start delay).

(#image_tagging)=

Image tagging

The process of classifying an image according to the wildlife species, other entities (e.g., human, vehicle), or conditions within the image. Image tagging may follow image classification to further classify characteristics of the individuals (e.g., age class, sex class, or behaviour) or entities within the image.

(#image_trigger_mode)=

**\*Image Trigger Mode**

The type of trigger mode used to capture the image as reported in the image Exif data (e.g., "Time Lapse", "Motion Detection," "CodeLoc Not Entered," "External Sensor"). Record "Unknown" if not known.

(#image_sequence_comments)=

**\*Image/Sequence Comments**

Comments describing additional details about the image/sequence.

(#image_sequence_date_time)=

**Image/Sequence Date Time (DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM:SS)**

The date and time of an image, or the image chosen to represent the sequence, recorded as "DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM:SS" (e.g., 22-Jul-2018 11:02:02).

Sequence date/time information may be reported for a "representative image" of a sequence (i.e., the image with the most information). For example, if three images were included in a sequence, but the Sex Class could only be discerned in the second image [all else remaining equal], the second image would be the best representative image of the sequence.

The Image/Sequence Date Time differs from the Image Set Start Date Time which refers to the first image or video collected during a deployment.

(#imperfect_detection)=

Imperfect detection

Species are often detected "imperfectly," meaning that they are not always detected when they are present (e.g., due to cover of vegetation, cryptic nature or small size) (MacKenzie et al., 2004).

(#independent_detections)=

(#intensity_of_use)=

Intensity of use (Keim et al., 2019)

"The expected number of use events of a specific resource unit during a unit of time… [which characterizes] how frequently a particular resource unit is used" (Keim et al., 2019). The intensity of use differs from the probability of use (which characterizes "the probability of at least one use event of that resource unit during a unit of time"; Keim et al., 2019).

(#inter_detection_interval)=

Inter-detection interval

A user-defined threshold used to define a single "detection event" (i.e., independent "events") for group of images or video clips (e.g., 30 minutes or 1 hour). The threshold should be recorded in the Survey Design Description.

(#mods_inventory)=

Inventory

Rapid assessment surveys to determine what species are present in a given area at a given point in time; there is no attempt made to quantify aspects of communities or populations (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017).

(#age_class_juvenile)=

Animals in their first summer, with clearly juvenile features (e.g., spots); mammals older than neonates but that still require parental care.

(#kernel_density_estimator)=

A method used to estimate the abundance of partially marked populations using the number of marked individuals, the number of unmarked individuals, and the detection probability from marked animals (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017). MR is similar to capture-recapture (CR; Karanth, 1995; Karanth & Nichols, 1998) models, except only a portion of animals are individually identified.

(#metadata)=

Metadata

Data that provides information about other data (e.g., the number of images on an SD card).

(#mods_modelling_assumption)=

Model assumption

Explicitly stated (or implicitly premised) conventions, choices and other specifications (e.g., about the data, wildlife ecology/behaviour, the relationships between variables, etc.) on which a particular modelling approach is based that allows the model to provide valid inference.

(#mods_modelling_approach)=

Modelling approach

The method used to analyze the camera data, which should depend on the state variable, e.g., occupancy models [MacKenzie et al., 2002], spatially explicit capture recapture (SECR) for density estimation [Chandler and Royle, 2013], etc. and the Target Species.

(#settings_motion_image_interval)=

**Motion Image Interval (seconds)**

The time (in seconds) between images within a multi-image sequence that occur due to motion, heat, or activation of external detector devices. The Motion Image Interval is pre-set in the camera’s settings by the user, but the time at which the camera collects images because of this setting is influenced by the presence of movement or heat. For example, if the camera was set to take 3 images per event at a Motion Image Interval of 3 seconds when the camera detects motion or heat, the first image will be collected (e.g., at 09:00:00), the second image will be collected 3 seconds later (09:00:03), and the third will be collected 3 seconds after that (09:00:06).

This setting differs from the Quiet Period in that the delay occurs between images contained within a multi-image sequence, rather than between multi-image sequences (as in Quiet Period). If a Motion Image Interval was not set, enter "0" seconds (i.e., instantaneous).

(#mods_negative_binomial)=

Negative binomial (NB) regression (Mullahy, 1986)

A regression model used for count data with overdispersion but without zero-inflation. [relative abundance indices]


(#mods_n_mixture)=

N-mixture models

A class of models for estimating absolute abundance using replicated counts of animals from several different sites; site-specific counts are treated as independent random variables to estimate the number of animals available for capture at each site; detection is imperfect (Royle 2004). N-mixture models are a type of site-structured model (i.e., that "treat each camera as though it samples... [a] distinct population within a larger meta-population" [Clarke et al., 2023]).

(#northing_camera_location)=

**Northing Camera Location**

The northing UTM coordinate of the camera location (e.g., "5962006"). Record using the NAD83 datum. Leave blank if recording the Latitude instead.

(#occupancy)=

Occupancy

The probability a site is occupied by the species.

(#mods_occupancy)=

Occupancy model (MacKenzie et al., 2002)

A modelling approach used to account for imperfect detection by first evaluating the detection probability of a species via detection histories (i.e., present or absent) to determine the probability of the true presence or absence of a species at a site (MacKenzie et al., 2002).

(#mods_overdispersion)=

Overdispersion

A variance significantly larger than the mean (Bliss & Fisher, 1953); greater variability in a set of data than predicted by the error structure of the model (Harrison et al., 2018); excess variability can be caused by zero inflation, non-independence of counts, or both (Zuur et al., 2009).

(#sampledesign_paired)=

Paired design

A form of “clustered design” where two cameras that are placed closely together to increase detection probability ("paired cameras"), to evaluate certain conditions ("paired sites", e.g., on- or off trails), etc. Paired placements can help to account for other variability that might occur (i.e., variation in habitat quality). For some objectives, pairs of cameras might be considered subsamples within another sampling design (e.g., simple random, stratified random, systematic).

(#typeid_partially_marked)=

Partially marked individuals / populations / species

Individuals, populations, or species (varies with modelling approach and context) that have a suite of partially identifying traits (e.g., antler points, sex class, age class). For populations/species, those in which a proportion of individuals carry marks or in which individuals themselves are partially marked.

(#settings_photos_per_trigger)=

**Photos Per Trigger**

(#settings_quiet_period)=

**Quiet Period (seconds)**

The user-defined camera setting which provides the time (in seconds) between shutter "triggers" if the camera was programmed to pause between firing initially and firing a second time. If a Quiet Period was not set, enter "0."

Also known as "time lag" (depending on the Camera Make and Camera Model; Palmer et al., 2018). The Quiet Period differs from the Motion Image Interval in that the delay occurs between multi-image sequences rather than between the images contained within multi-image sequences (as in the Motion Image Interval).

(#sampledesign_random)=

Random (or “simple random”) design

Cameras occur at randomized camera locations (or sample stations) across the area of interest, sometimes with a predetermined minimum distance between camera locations (or sample stations).

A recent modification of the REM (Nakashima et al., 2018) that substitutes staying time (i.e., the cumulative time in the cameras' detection zone) for movement speed (staying time and movement speed are inversely proportional) (Cappelle et al., 2021).

(#mods_rem)=

Random encounter model (REM) (Rowcliffe et al., 2008, 2013)

A method used to estimate the density of unmarked populations; uses the rate of independent captures, an estimate of movement rate, average group size, and the area sampled by the remote camera.

(#recovery_time)=

The time necessary for the camera to prepare to capture the next photo after the previous one has been recorded (Trolliet et al., 2014).

(#fov_registration_area)=

Registration area

The area in which an animal entering has at least some probability of being captured on the image.

(#mods_relative_abundance)=

Relative abundance indices

An index of relative abundance. When observational data is converted to a detection rate (i.e., the frequency [count] of independent detections of a species within a distinct time period). An index can be a count of animals or any sign that is expected to vary with population size (Caughley, 1977; O'Brien, 2011).

(#remaining_battery_percent)=

**\*Remaining Battery (%)**

The remaining battery power (%) of batteries within a camera.

(#mods_royle_nichols)=

Royle-Nichols model (Royle & Nichols, 2003; MacKenzie et al., 2006)

A method used to estimate population abundance or density, which assumes that individuals are counted only once per sampling occasion (Royle, 2004), but that does not require all individuals to be marked. Royle-Nichols models are a type of site-structured model (i.e., that "treat each camera as though it samples... [a] distinct population within a larger meta-population" [Clarke et al., 2023]).

(#sample_station)=

Sample station

A grouping of two or more non-independent camera locations, such as when cameras are clustered or paired (recorded as "Sample Station Name").

(#sample_station_name)=

A sequential alphanumeric identifier for each grouping of two more non-independent camera locations (when cameras are deployed in clusters, pairs, or arrays; e.g., “ss1” in “ss1_bh1”, “ss1_bh2”, “ss1_bh3” etc.). Leave blank if not applicable.

(#baitlure_scent_lure)=

Scent lure

Any material that draws animals closer via their sense of smell (Schlexer, 2008).

(#sd_card_id)=

The equipment used to secure the camera (e.g., "Security box," "Bracket," "Bracket + Screws," or "None").

(#sequence)=

Sequence

A user-defined group of images or video clips considered as a single “detection event“ (recorded as "Sequence Name"); often users choose a certain time threshold (or “inter-detection interval“) to define independent “events“; e.g., 30 minutes or 1 hour. The threshold should be recorded in the Survey Design Description).

(#sequence_name)=

**Sequence Name**

A unique alphanumeric identifier for a multi-image sequence. The Sequence Name should ideally consist of the Deployment Name and the names of the first and last images and videos in the sequence (separated by "*") (i.e., "Deployment Name"*"img\_#[name of first image in sequence]"*"img*\#[name of last image in sequence] (e.g., "bh1_22-Jul-2018_img_001-img_005"). Leave blank if not applicable.

(#service_retrieval)=

Service/Retrieval

When a crew has gone to a location to service or retrieve a remote camera.

**\*Service/Retrieval Comments**

Comments describing additional details about the service/retrieval.

(#service_retrieval_crew)=

**Service/Retrieval Crew**

The first and last names of the individuals who collected data during the service/retrieval visit.

(#service_retrieval_metadata)=

Service/retrieval metadata

Metadata that should be collected each time a camera location is visited to service or retrieve a camera, including data on any change to the camera location, sampling period, and/or setting type (e.g., not baited and then baited later). The relevant metadata fields that should be collected differ when a camera is deployed vs. serviced or retrieved.

Refer to Appendix - Table A5 and the Camera Service/Retrieval Field Datasheet.

(#service_retrieval_visit)=

Service/Retrieval visit

When a crew has gone to a location to service or retrieve a remote camera.

(#sex_class)=

**Sex Class**

The sex classification of individual(s) being categorized (e.g., "Male," "Female," or "Unknown").

(#mods_ste)=

Space-to-event (STE) model (Moeller et al., 2018)

A method used to estimate abundance or density that accounts for variable detection probability through the use of time-lapse images and is unaffected by animal movement rates (collapses sampling intervals to an instant in time, and thus estimates are unaffected by animal movement rates) (Moeller et al., 2018).

(#spatial_autocorrelation)=

Spatial autocorrelation

The tendency for locations that are closer together to be more similar.

(#mods_sc)=

Spatial count (SC) model / Unmarked spatial capture-recapture (Chandler & Royle, 2013)

A method used to estimate the density of unmarked populations; similar to SECR (Borchers & Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle & Young, 2008; Royle et al., 2009); however, SC models account for individuals' unknown identities using the spatial pattern of detections (Chandler & Royle, 2013; Sun et al., 2022). SC uses trap-specific counts to estimate the location and number of activity centres to estimate density.

(#mods_smr)=

Spatial mark-resight (SMR) (Chandler & Royle, 2013; Sollmann et al., 2013a, 2013b)

A method used to estimate the density of "partially marked populations by combining... [detection] histories of marked [individuals] and counts of unmarked [individuals]" (Doran-Myers, 2018) over several occasions (Sollman et al., 2013a; Rich et al., 2014; Whittington et al., 2018). SMR models can be implemented using different statistical frameworks, including Bayesian estimation (Royle and Young, 2008; Morin et al., 2022).

(#mods_2flankspim)=

Spatial partial identity model (2-flank SPIM) (Augustine et al., 2018)

A method used to estimate the density of partially marked populations in which the “spatial locations of where partial identity samples are captured to probabilistically resolve their complete identities” (Augustine et al., 2018). Paired sampling design is commonly used to capture both the right and left flanks of an animal to resolve individual identities (Augustine et al., 2018). 2-flank SPIM is an extension of the SCR model (Borchers & Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle & Young, 2008; Royle et al., 2009).

(#mods_scr_secr)=

Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) / Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) (Borchers & Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle & Young, 2008; Royle et al., 2009)

The SECR (or SCR) method is used to estimate the density of marked populations; an extension of traditional capture-recapture (CR; Karanth, 1995; Karanth & Nichols, 1998) models (Karanth, 1995; Karanth & Nichols, 1998) that explicitly accounts for camera location and animal movement (Burgar et al., 2018). SECR models use spatially referenced individual capture histories to infer where animals' home range centres are, assuming that detection probability decreases with increasing distance between cameras and home range centres (Clarke et al., 2023). SECR models can be implemented using different statistical frameworks, including Bayesian estimation (Royle and Young, 2008; Morin et al., 2022).

(#species)=

The distance from the camera to a stake (in metres to the nearest 0.05 m). Leave blank if not applicable.

(#state_variable)=

State variable

A formal measure that summarizes the state of a community or population at a particular time (Wearn & Glover-Kapfer, 2017), e.g., species richness or population abundance.

(#sampledesign_stratified)=

Stratified design

The area of interest is divided into smaller strata (e.g., habitat type, disturbance levels), and cameras are placed within each stratum (e.g., 15%, 35% and 50% of sites within high, medium, and low disturbance strata).

(#sampledesign_stratified_random)=

Stratified random design

The area of interest is divided into smaller strata (e.g., habitat type, disturbance levels), and then a proportional random sample of sites is selected within each stratum (e.g., 15%, 35% and 50% of sites within high, medium and low disturbance strata).

(#study_area)=

Study area

A unique research, inventory or monitoring area (spatial boundary) within a project (there may be multiple study areas within a single project) (recorded as "Study Area Name").

(#age_class_subadult)=

**Subadult**

Animals older than a "Juvenile" but not yet an "Adult"; a "Subadult" may be further classified into "Young of the Year" or "Yearling."

(#age_class_subadult_yearling)=

**Subadult - Yearling**

(#survey)=

Survey

A unique deployment period (temporal extent) within a project (recorded as "Survey Name").

(#survey_design)=

**Survey Design**

The spatial arrangement of remote cameras within the study area for an individual survey. If “Hierarchical (multiple)\*”, include additional details in the Survey Design Description.

Note that we refer to different configurations of cameras more generally as study design and sampling design; however, the term “Survey Design“ refers to study design as it applies to an individual survey. There may be multiple Survey Designs for surveys within a project; if this occurs, the Survey Design should be reported separately for each survey.

(#survey_design_description)=

**\*Survey Design Description**

A description of any additional details about the Survey Design.

(#survey_name)=

**Survey Name**

A unique alphanumeric identifier for each survey period (e.g., "fortmc_001").

(#survey_objectives)=

**Survey Objectives**

The specific objectives of each survey within a project, including the Target Species, the state variables (e.g., occupancy, density), and proposed modelling approach(es). Survey Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (i.e., SMART).

(#sampledesign_systematic)=

Systematic design

Camera locations occur in a regular pattern (e.g., a grid pattern) across the study area.

(#sampledesign_systematic_random)=

Systematic random design

Camera locations are selected using a two-stage approach. Firstly, girds are selected systematically (to occur within a regular pattern) across the study area. The location of the camera within each grid is then selected randomly.

(#tag)=

**Tag**

When individuals, or groups of individuals, are categorized within an image, regardless of whether the information applies to all of the individuals in the image. A single tag is applied to categorize one or more individuals with the same combination of characteristics (e.g., Adult Males displaying the same Behaviour). Conversely, multiple tags are applied when individuals in an image differ in their characteristics (e.g., an Adult and a Juvenile, all else remaining equal, are tagged separately). This could also occur for Age Class, Behaviour, Human Transport Mode/Activity, etc. Since multiple tags can occur for a single image, there may be multiple data rows for the same image (if the Event Type is at the "Tag" level).

(#target_species)=

**Target Species**

The common name(s) of the species that the survey was designed to detect.

(#sampledesign_targeted)=

Targeted design

Camera locations or sample stations are placed in areas that are known or suspected to have higher activity levels (e.g., game trails, mineral licks).

(#test_image)=

Test image

An image taken from a camera after it has been set up to provide a permanent record of the visit metadata (e.g., Sample Station Name, Camera Location Name, Deployment Name, Crew, and Deployment Start Date Time [DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM:SS]).

Taking a test image can be useful to compare the information from the image to that of which was collected on the Camera Service/Retrieval Field Datasheet after retrieval and can help in reducing recording errors.

(#test_image_taken)=

**\*Test Image Taken**

Whether a test image (i.e., an image taken from a camera after it has been set up to provide a permanent record of the visit metadata) was taken. Arm the camera, from \~5 m in front, walk towards the camera while holding the Test Image Sheet.

(#mods_tifc)=

Time in front of the camera (TIFC) (Huggard, 2018; Warbington & Boyce, 2020; tested in Becker et al., 2022)

A method used to estimate density that treats camera image data as quadrat samples (Becker et al., 2022).

(#timelapse_image)=

Time-lapse image

Images that are taken at regular intervals (e.g., hourly or daily, on the hour). It is critical to take a minimum of one time-lapse image per day at a consistent time (e.g., 12:00 pm [noon]) to create a record of camera functionality and local environmental conditions (e.g., snow cover, plant growth, etc.). Time-lapse images may always be useful for modelling approaches that require estimation of the "viewshed" ("viewshed density estimators" such as REM or time-to-event (TTE) models; see Moeller et al., [2018] for advantages and disadvantages).

(#mods_tte)=

Time-to-event (TTE) model (Moeller et al., 2018)

A method used to estimate abundance or density from the detection rate while accounting for animal movement rates (Moeller et al., 2018). The TTE model assumes perfect detection (though there is a model extension to account for imperfect detection that requires further testing).

(#total_number_of_camera_days)=

Total number of camera days

The number of days that all cameras were active during the survey.

(#trigger_event)=

Trigger “event”

An activation of the camera detector(s) that initiates the capture of a single or multiple images, or the recording of video.

(#settings_trigger_modes)=

**Trigger Mode(s)** (camera settings)

The camera setting(s) that determine how the camera will triggerby motion ("Motion Image"), at set intervals ("Time-lapse image"), and/or by video ("Video"; possible with newer camera models, such as Reconyx HP2X).

(#settings_trigger_sensitivity)=

**Trigger Sensitivity**

The camera setting responsible for how sensitive a camera is to activation (to "triggering") via the infrared and/or heat detectors (if applicable, e.g., Reconyx HyperFire cameras have a choice between "Low," "Low/Med," "Med," "Med/High," "High," "Very high" and "Unknown").

(#trigger_speed)=

Trigger speed

The time delay necessary for the camera to shoot a photo once an animal has interrupted the infrared beam within the camera's detection zone (Trolliet et al., 2014). Trigger speed differs from Motion Image Interval (a camera setting specified by the user) in that the trigger speed is inherent to the Camera Make and Camera Model (e.g., two different cameras, models both with a Motion Image Interval set to "no delay," may not be able to capture images at the same speed).

(#typeid_unmarked)=

Unmarked individuals / populations / species

Individuals, populations, or species (varies with modelling approach and context) that cannot be identified using natural or artificial markings (e.g., coat patterns, scars, tags, collars). Unmarked population models rely on supplementary data (e.g., animal movement speed) and/or assumptions as a surrogate for individual identification; that is, to distinguish between multiple detections of the same individual from detections of multiple individuals when individuals do not have unique features (Gilbert et al., 2020; Morin et al., 2022).

(#settings_userlabel)=

User label

A label (up to 16 characters) that can be programmed in the camera’s settings, and that will be visible in the data band of all photos and videos taken by the camera (Reconyx, 2018). It is recommended that users program the Sample Station Name/Camera Location Name as the user label, which serves as a means to confirm which Sample Station Name/Camera Location Name is associated with the images/videos.

(#utm_zone_camera_location)=

**UTM Zone Camera Location**

The number corresponding to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid zone where the camera was placed (e.g., “12”). UTM is a coordinate system that divides the earth into grid zones that are identified with a number (representing a width of latitude) and letter (representing the hemisphere).

In Alberta the UTM zones are either 11, 12, or TTM. Enter all other UTM zones in the Camera Location Comments field (e.g., zones 7-10 for British Columbia), or use Latitude and Longitude instead of UTM coordinates.

(#settings_video_length)=

**\*Video Length (seconds)**

If applicable, describes the camera setting that specifies the minimum video duration (in seconds) that the camera will record when triggered. Leave blank if not applicable.

(#fov_viewshed)=

Viewshed

The area visible to the camera as determined by its lens angle (in degrees) and trigger distance (Moeller et al., 2023).

(#fov_viewshed_density_estimators)=

Viewshed density estimators

Methods used to estimate the abundance of unmarked populations from observations of animals that relate animal observations to the space directly sampled by each camera’s viewshed (Moeller et al., 2023); they result in viewshed density estimates that can be extrapolated to abundance within broader sampling frames (Gilbert et al., 2020; Moeller et al., 2023).

(#visit)=

Visit

When a crew has gone to a location to deploy, service, or retrieve a remote camera.

(#visit_comments)=

**\*Visit Comments**

Comments describing additional details about the deployment and/or service/retrieval visits.

(#visit_metadata)=

Metadata that should be collected each time a camera location is visited to deploy, service or retrieve a camera. Other relevant metadata fields that should be collected differ when a camera is deployed vs. serviced or retrieved.

Refer to Appendix A - Table A5, Camera Deployment Field Datasheet, and Camera Service/Retrieval Field Datasheet.

(#baitlure_visual_lure)=

Visual lure

Any material that draws animals closer via their sense of sight (Schlexer, 2008).

(#walktest)=

Walktest

A test performed to ensure the camera height, tilt, etc., adequately captures the desired detection zone. The user will 1) activate the walktest mode, 2) attach the camera at the desired height / angle, 3) walk in front of the camera to a specified distance (i.e., the "Walktest Distance," e.g., 5 m), and 4) wave their hand in front of the camera (usually at ground level and a chosen height [i.e., the "Walktest Height," e.g., 0.8 m]) to determine if the camera is activating (a light on the camera will flash).

(#walktest_complete)=

**\*Walktest Complete**

Whether a walktest was performed to ensure the camera height, tilt, etc., adequately captures the desired detection zone. The user will 1) activate the walktest mode, 2) attach the camera at the desired height / angle, 3) walk in front of the camera to a specified distance (i.e., the "Walktest Distance," e.g., 5 m), and 4) wave their hand in front of the camera (usually at ground level and a chosen height [i.e., the "Walktest Height," e.g., 0.8 m]) to determine if the camera is activating (a light on the camera will flash).

(#walktest_distance)=

**Walktest Distance (m)**

The horizontal distance from the camera at which the crew performs the walktest (metres; to the nearest 0.05 m). Leave blank if not applicable.

(#mods_zinb)=

Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression (McCullagh & Nelder, 1989)

A regression model used in the setting of excess zeros (zero-inflation) and overdispersion. This approach is a two-part model, where the zero-inflation is modelled separately from the counts and assumes that the count (abundance) is "conditional" on the zero-inflation model (occurrence) model. [relative abundance indices]

(#mods_zip)=

Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression (Lambert, 1992)

A regression model for count data that both follows the Poisson distribution and contains excess zeros (Lambert, 1992). ZIP models are only appropriate for data for which the overdispersion is not solely due to zero-inflation. [relative abundance indices]

(#mods_zero_inflation)=

Zero-inflation

An excess of zeros that is "so large that those expected in standard distributions (e.g., normal, Poisson, binomial, negative binomial and beta)" (Heilbron, 1994) violate the assumptions of such distributions (Martin et al., 2005). Excess zeroes can be a result of ecological effects ("true" zeros) or due to sampling or observer error ("false zeros") (Martin et al., 2005). Excess zeroes contribute to overdispersion, but they don't necessarily account for all excess variability (Blasco-Moreno et al., 2019).
