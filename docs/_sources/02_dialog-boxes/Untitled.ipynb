    "**Capture-recapture (CR) model / Capture-mark-recapture (CMR) model (Karanth, 1995; Karanth & Nichols, 1998)**: A method of estimating the abundance or density of marked populations using the number of animals detected and the likelihood animals will be detected (detection probability). CR (Karanth, 1995; Karanth & Nichols, 1998) can be used to estimate vital rates where all newly detected unmarked animals become marked and are distinguishable in future (Efford, 2022). Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR; Borchers & Efford, 2008; Efford, 2004; Royle & Young, 2008) models have largely replaced CR and CMR models and provide more accurate density estimates (Blanc et al., 2013, Obbard et al., 2010, Sollmann et al., 2011).\n",

    "To estimate density using camera trap CR, we must first estimate population size ùëÅ. CR models use individuals‚Äô detection histories ‚Äì that is, the record of when each individual was photographed or not photographed (i.e., (re)captured or not (re)captured) ‚Äì to solve for ùëÅ (Figure 3; Royle 2020). Population-level detection histories look like a matrix of 1s and 0s, where 1s signify that an individual was captured during a given sampling occasion ùëò, and 0s signify that the individual was not captured during that occasion (Royle 2020, Royle et al. 2014). The number of individuals photographed at least once over the course of the study (i.e., the count of animals captured) is ùëõ.  \n",
    "Importantly, the count of animals is not the same as the size of the population (i.e., ùëõ ‚â† ùëÅ). Some individuals will never be photographed during a study, even though they are present and able to be detected (i.e., they are in ùëÅ but not in ùëõ; Royle 2020). Using the matrix of detection histories, we must therefore calculate the likelihood animals will be detected by an array of camera traps ‚Äì that is, detection probability p (Royle 2020). \n",
    "Taking this information together, we can calculate population size ùëÅ as:\n",

    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which is often referred to as the canonical estimator of population size (Royle 2020). Population size ùëÅ can then be divided by an estimate of the area of the sampling frame ùê¥ to obtain density. \n",
    "CR models have important limitations ‚Äì notably that they do not consider the spatial configuration of camera traps or the spatial pattern of animal detections. This gives rise to two major issues: \n",
    "The sampling frame ùê¥ is not known (Chandler and Royle, 2013). In other words: the true area animals occupy is never measured, only approximated using adhoc approaches (e.g., using a buffer strip around the trap array; Rich et al., 2014, Sollmann, 2018). Consequently, density cannot be calculated explicitly (Chandler and Royle, 2013), and CR-derived density estimates are somewhat arbitrary and difficult to compare across studies (Green et al., 2020, Royle et al., 2014, Sollmann, 2018). \n",
    "Detection probability is assumed to be the same across all individuals and sampling occasions, even though the likelihood a given individual is detected at a given camera trap will change with its proximity to that trap. An animal that occupies territory far away from a trap is less likely to be detected there than one that lives nearby, for example (Morin et al. 2022). \n",
    "The standard CR model has largely been phased out with the advent of spatially-explicit CR models (see 2.1.2 Spatial Capture-Recapture; Burton et al. 2015, Sollmann 2008), which address the shortcomings of CR and have been shown to produce more accurate density estimates (e.g., Blanc et al. 2013, Obbard et al. 2010, Sollmann et al. 2011).\n",
